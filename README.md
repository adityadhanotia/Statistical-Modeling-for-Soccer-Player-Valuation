# Statistical-Modeling-for-Soccer-Player-Valuation

Ever wondered what makes a soccer player worth millions? This fun project dives into a comprehensive soccer player dataset from Kaggle with 2300 entries and 44 variables, aiming to crack the code behind player valuations in the transfer market. Our hypothesis? Factors like age, goals, assists, nationality, and position influence a player's market value. We'll be using key predictors like goals scored, assists, passes, game minutes, position, and nationality to predict player value. Along the way, we performed a bunch of statistical tests such as Correlation Analysis, OLS Regression, and One-way ANOVA & Tukey's HSD. 

This project was an exciting dive into the world of sports analytics, using data to uncover the secrets behind player valuations!
